Configuration
=============

The store is configured by using a Python file that lets you overwrite base settings and configure required settings. A configuration can set or override any `Django setting <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/>`_ or Django plugin setting.

Production Configuration
------------------------
In order to get up a minimal production configuration you can extend the base production settings which expect your site to run on HTTPS and fill in the remaining bits:

.. note:: Absolutely make sure to generate a new **SECRET_KEY** value! Use the following command for instance to generate a token:

::

    env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc "a-zA-Z0-9-_\$\?" < /dev/urandom | head -c 64; echo

.. code-block:: python

    from TechKiteOFFICEappstore.settings.baseproduction import *

    # generate the SECRET_KEY by yourself for instance by using the following command:
    # env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc "a-zA-Z0-9-_\$\?" < /dev/urandom | head -c 64; echo
    SECRET_KEY = 'CRYPTO: CHANGE THIS VALUE!'
